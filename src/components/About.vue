						<h3>Who we are</h3>
						<p>
							P.E.E.R. stands for Principally Educated Ensuring Recovery. <br> We created our program based off of our own personal recovery journeys. We believe that recovery is a lifestyle that is much deeper and richer than just not using substances and/or any process addiction. We honor the struggle, not fight it. We embrace the challenges and have learned to not fear failure. We see life as opportunities to find growth in the uncomfortable situations and use them as a map to an authentic self. 
							<br><br> These principles allow us to tear down the wall’s addiction built that held us back from becoming the men and women we were created for. We learn, grow, persevere, strive, and fail all the way to success. We redefined our lives as the men and women we are at our core, not as the circumstances of our past and what the world has said we are. We cultivate dreams. We turn those dreams to a reality. We become our personal definition of success! We become gratitude! We strive to impact and inspire the human race daily by putting in the work to become our true selves. We use our Higher Power’s gifts to be stewards of hope and love to all mankind. We become balanced in a healthy body, mind, and spirit. We have become accountable to another person. P.E.E.R. is the support, the guide, and the advocate for every step taken in our participant’s personal journey. <br> Allow us to help you or your loved one create a vision and achieve greatness!
