							<h4>Life coaching</h4>
							<div class="text">
								<p>
									At P.E.E.R. we help participants develop S.M.A.R.T. goals along with a personalized routine for them in conjunction with a recovery program of their choice.  We spend time with participants throughout the week to help hold them accountable to their goals and to encourage them to continue living a life of principles.  We belief that recovery is more than just not using drugs and/or alcohol. It is a lifestyle.  That lifestyle should be built on a good routine, an attitude of gratitude, a life of principles, and a sense of accomplishment by achieving one’s personal goals. We know these factors all work together to help participants find a life of meaning personal to them. 
									We do encourage a twelve-step program and belief in a Higher Power as it is instrumental for us at P.E.E.R. for our own recovery.

							<h4>Transports</h4>
							<div class="text">
								<p>
									At P.E.E.R. we believe that a transport is more than getting a participant from point A to point B. It is about providing and building hope. It doesn’t matter whether one’s recovery voyage is just getting started or we are providing support and safe travels for continuing on the journey. We are here to be a convoy as one travel at any phase of early sobriety. Safety and wellbeing are paramount to us. Every trip comes with complimentary patience, love and understanding along with our transporter’s personal experience, strength, and hope as the in-transit entertainment. 
									Allow us to be you or your loved one’s recovery co-pilot for a trip.
